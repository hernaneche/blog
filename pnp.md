##P vs NP problem##

###Improbable but possible###
Trying to guess a meaningful number within a list of possibles in the hope of finding some useful information like music, science, images, movies, is terribly unlikely, is a so improbable bet that it's faster to put a whole universe to evolve rather than find a piece of art or any useful information by doing an uninformed blind search or lucky guessing it, but strangely enough, it is not impossible. 

If guessing right is so ridiculously improbable, **how do we actually get all these things after all?** 

When we talk about the difficulty of doing something it's important to see from where we started, that's the conditional probability for something to exist, *given that we have an already made universe and life*, is a more probable bet, than if we consider the naive probability of the something from nothing, the whole from scratch, that's an too improbable thing, if we ask for it, we babble about big bang, evolution of the physical universe, evolution of the bio-cultural universe, and so on, as other mundane and equally confusing terms: inspiration, interaction, thinking, working, preserving what works and eliminating what doesn't, computing, real life experience, etc..

###Hard for whom?###
It depends, into the jargon of P vs NP problem, if solutions scale well with input size, these are P problems, i.e. the processing effort to compute a bigger instance of the same general problem will grow in proportion with the input size (or polynomially with it), however in the more general case of NP problems it's only the verification of the solution what scale well with the input size, i.e. acceptable effort let us recognize the solution, but how to compute that solution in the first place? it varies,we don't know. In best cases, an NP problem can also be a P problem, in the next less good scenario it's possible to solve it trying all posibilities, perhaps superpolynomial slowly, exponentially slowly or even slower, sometimes not even that, nothing ensures us how to get the solution, still nothing explicitly *forbid us* to solve it, any *particular instance* of a general NP problem by getting it from a hat, we can verify later the answer with an algorithm in P, but we don't have that magic hat. The word 'hard' is relative here, it's hard, if we try to reach a general solution, not a particular one, we use a computer model with an algorithm for all instances, and this is strange, outside the world of theory of computation, we never solve different size problems with same kind of tool, but we still wants it to be the case in computing, it's seems a caprice. 

###P are natural-born NP###
*How do we actually get all things*, we can indeed theorize about a super metaphysical perspective from which reality is the output of some meta-algorithm in meta-P ( seen as P kind from that meta point of view); but from our humble perspective that it's not the case, in general our problems are not in P, even more, none of our P problems ever born in P. Why? because we first had to discover the problem, its domain, its language, and so on, so adding up the "operations" needed for discovering it, and then running it, the total procedure is not in P, because the first stage is not even deterministic.
 Anyone can learn how to sum a many digit numbers with a known method in P, but we should remember that things we know today, like the numeral system with its positional notation, didn't came with us, but evolve with us, so those inventions were crafted through experiences, today they can help simplify our problems, perhaps at expenses of making others be more complicated; numbers, symbols and methods used by our today's machines and culture, as for example the standard addition algorithm, have been discovered through evolution, it is from non-deterministic inspiration, experiences, unsolvables by any algorithm, that inspiration and experiences were required so that we have them in P today.  Whatever it is, call it universe evolution, or you name it, is doing its magic, and it's turning *some* of our *particular* NP problems into P problems, whatever is running culture to genes, is more than memoizing. 

We could complain at this point by saying : "evolution takes too much freedom in solving problems, while P and NP is a well defined and specific bounded question, valid for models of computation like Turing Machines", we could still ask : where did we get the concept of computation and computers in the first place? what are computers made from? what are mental models made from? and so on, I bet none of these models were obtained from an algorithm in P.
We could insist in saying that there is no need to trace the origin of something, or to ask a question about it, but also P vs NP is neither a question about something but a question about all questions, so for this infinitely broad question, I felt comfortable giving, at least, an infinite broad answer.
 
###Sources of clues ###
I hypothesize that every single particular problem instance can be set and solved through universe evolution but not all instances at once, we can of course also solve the problem of creating a problem that is hard to solve or that can't be solved in any given context, but not in every context, whenever we face a problem as long as there is an outside of it, we can get clues from there, via non-deterministic experiences (non-deterministic from our point of view, regardless of whether they were super-determined from above or not), in any case we could perceive them as having some nondeterministic surprise and randomness. Our everyday life experience is full of interaction, a fated confrontation with non-deterministic clues, call it environment, accidents, or noise if you like, but they can not be avoided, and while we try to avoid them, as we fix rules within maths, computers, language, culture, etc.. we face other new problems whose solution is very hard and is considered intractable, it makes perfect sense!! it's *because* once we determine game rules, we forbid those external clues that create it, as a self limitation to gain control, to sustain the game: we seem to allow ourselves to take the problem statement and language from dirty accidental evolved ways of our non-deterministic history and existence, *but* when it comes to tackle the problem, we carry it out into a limited toy ruled world with the pretensions of being fixed, controlled, clean and formal, to avoid flaws; we are allowing informal noisy things to be the source of our problems and theories (and ourselves) but once formalized we try to silence that world and to solve it all within a theory, without the use of those non-deterministic sources, that's very unfair!

###Learning###
Imagine a freshman trying to solve a math test problem (for example calculating the area behind a curve), the problem is in NP for him, because he knows no method to tackle it, but can easily check the result from the teacher, the problem is in P for someone who knows calculus. He could also solve it by copying the answer from a classmate, copying a student with good grades is like getting data from a non-deterministic oracle. 
The teacher could say that copying the answer was a prohibited tool, it's very reasonable, forbidding actions for *exams* are ok, also mimics constraints that are always found in real problems, but on the other hand there is no way to learn without getting non-deterministic data, in creating, as in learning the non-deterministic part of the whole process is a mandatory part, learning *is* to get external non-deterministic data, it's in NP by definition, the very act of measuring is non-deterministic, then non-deterministic approaches are *required* for creating and learning. Learning a technique is like gaining non-deterministic tools, non-deterministic ways of seeing a problem, deterministically.

###General, particular, dynamic###
Perhaps *our general problems* and *general* whims are not an issue of nature, nothing that matter much to the universal evolution, but some of *our particular* problems are surely aligned with hers; evolution is patient and can reach *her general things* from particular steps, including our steps. So, if reality, evolution, existence, randomness, universe, again you name it, can solve any particular issue that *she* cares about ( one can argue about whether nature have or not intentions, but we can be sure she's making things more efficient over time, that's her achievements, for example in building bodies and brains, did she want it? oh it doesn't matter, she did quite well) and as we are part of it we also can, as long we get her way of doing things, it is by getting interested in *particular* problems, by allowing ourselves to do whatever, and by the use of non-deterministic experiences as clues, it could make any problem in NP becomes P, not now, but slowly through time, and of course not all problems at once.
Our *general* problems as general methods, big numbers, not to mention infinite things, are too much for us to *solve* them, perhaps we should not give up NP-complete whims but only because the search itself is inspiring, as long as we don't confuse them with particular concrete problems.
Time brings solutions to every single particular problem in NP that we face, out of particular hats, avoiding the pretension of using a specific model of computation, or the worse pretension of solving all at once, like in P=NP, but any *particular* problem in NP will tends to become P as evolution time go by, and then new NP problems will come, (any but not every) NP → time → P, stay tuned, because it's also our life what lies in the middle arrows.
